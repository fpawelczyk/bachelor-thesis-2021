# My bachelor-thesis: The Political Power of Economic Ideas - Summer 2021

This Repo is accociated with my BA Thesis that I wrote in Summer 2021. It is also my first 'bigger' coding experience.

My inspiration for this project arose while reading Mark Blyth’s
Austerity. His analysis and historical refurbishment on how ideas got a predominant policy paradigm are cru-
cial. Blyth thinks that ideas in different forms (e.g. elite assumptions that constrain cognitive range) can shape
the life of millions of people, due to their influence on policy-maker’s perception, which again affect the policies
put into practice. After 2008 (great financial crisis) austerity caused a cut in social spendings; this had a direct
effect on the distribution of income and wealth and is often seen as putting the lower income households at a
disadvantage since they rely on social services to a greater extent (Blyth 2013). Before reading Blyth’s work,
I was not aware of the immense distributional effects of fiscal policies and, more importantly, the effect of
no fiscal policies at all. 

To understand Germany’s expansionary fiscal policy to fight the economic downturn
due to Covid-19 I used state of the art CSS methods and theories from political science, STS and sociology.
Several newspaper articles strengthened my hunch that the discipline of economics and its members play an
important role in policy making through delivering evidence-based advice. Hirschman and Berman offered me
a framework to understand how economists potentially influence those policies, namely professional authority,
institutional positions and influencing cognitive infrastructures of policy-makers (Hirschman and Berman 2014).

So, I analysed more than 100.000 economics papers using R (I mainly used the quanteda package (Benoit et al.
2018)) to locate certain words which represent specific concepts – namely, state interventionism and laissez-faire
economic policies. Therefore, I created different dictionaries and made use of semi-supervised sentiment analysis
(Watanabe 2021) to find out if these concepts got better or worse sentiments over time. After that, I traced 
these ideas in the German policy arena (Budgetary Debate) to see whether scientific trends can be observed
among politicians as well. While I did find some evidence that supported my hypothesis, my results did not
show overwhelmingly clear patterns. Later, I identified the shortcomings of the dictionaries I used which showed
me insights on how important it is to have evidence-based, inter-researcher validated dictionaries for academic
texts and others (there exist a lot of dictionaries for political texts, but even here the language barrier is still
very large since most of today’s dictionaries focus on English language).
